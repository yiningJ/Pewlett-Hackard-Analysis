## Summary
72,458 roles need to be filled as the babyboomers are all retiring soon. However, we only have 1549 employees are eliginle for the mentorship program, so we should develop more employees to join the program.
We can also analyze on how many are retiring each year, and how many people will be eligiable to join the mentorship program in the following years.
